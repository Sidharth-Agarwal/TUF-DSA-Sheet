# macOS/Linux executables (files without extensions)

!*/
!*.*
!Makefile

# *.exe - Ignores Windows executables (your existing rule)
# * - Ignores everything
# !*/ - But keeps all directories
# !*.* - But keeps all files with extensions (.cpp, .h, .md, etc.)
# !Makefile - But keeps Makefiles (they have no extension)
